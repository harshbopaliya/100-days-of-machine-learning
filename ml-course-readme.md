# 100 Days of ML - Campux Course

Welcome to my journey of learning Machine Learning through the **100 Days of ML** course from Campux. This repository documents each day's progress, including code, notes, and insights gathered along the way.

## Overview

The 100 Days of ML course is designed to build a solid foundation in machine learning, covering essential topics, hands-on projects, and practical examples. The primary goal is to gain familiarity with ML algorithms, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and other critical components of ML workflows.

## Contents

* **Day 1 - Day 10**: Introduction to Python, Numpy, and Pandas
* **Day 11 - Day 20**: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
* **Day 21 - Day 30**: Linear Regression and Model Evaluation
* **Day 31 - Day 40**: Classification Algorithms
* **Day 41 - Day 50**: Clustering and Unsupervised Learning
* **Day 51 - Day 60**: Neural Networks Basics
* **Day 61 - Day 70**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
* **Day 71 - Day 80**: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* **Day 81 - Day 90**: Model Optimization and Hyperparameter Tuning
* **Day 91 - Day 100**: Capstone Project and Review
